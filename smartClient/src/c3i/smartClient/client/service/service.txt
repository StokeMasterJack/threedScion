Not included here
    no MVC
    No Widget
    No FM or knowledge of sar solvers


Maybe included here
    probably no:    ajax load of imageModelJsonText
    probably yes:   parsing of imageModelJsonText

Yes included here:
    ImageModel service

    pre-fetch
    caching??
    async thing to avoid ui freeze up:
        fm fixup:
            definitely not

        imgUrlComputation:
            probably not: that should be provided in the mvc layer
                or even the gui layer


    action steps:

    Keep:
        ImageStack
            the data structure - nothing with DOM dependencies

    c3i - efcNoFm - service-api

        no skins
        no widgets

        no ThreedSession
        no ViewsSession
        no ViewSession
        no PicksSession
        no picks session
        no VtcLoader
        no BrandLoader
        no ViewModel
    c3i - efcNoFm - mvc-api
    c3i - efcNoFm - widget


    If we limit ourselves to:
        Fixup runs downstream
        API mode (not widget mode)

        then: what does c3i-api-noWidget-noFixup
            add above and beyond ImageModel

    Answer:

        vtcMap - gone
        fm
        ajax call to load IM *
        parse IM

        pre-fetch
        some caching??
            mostly, caching is provided by Repo (via response headers)
        maintaining state of currently off-screen slices

        i can skip the call to sha-map.json
            that should be done upstream


        efc - 3d client
            i am passed 3d model json as needed
                Q: is imJsonLoaded as part of EFC client FM load?




    * unless (of course) efc loads the IM and simply
                    passes it to me - im is good candidate for Lazy Bundle

    No fixup needed:
        fixup will be called upstream
        we are passed "already fixed" picks
        since fixup happens upstream:
            we will not be responsible for:
                calling fixup
                caching fixup results
                dealing with with doEvents
                    to ensure fixup does not hog the thread
