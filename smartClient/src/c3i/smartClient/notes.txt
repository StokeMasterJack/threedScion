There are 4 API's provided as part of C3I:

    c3i.smartClient.service
    c3i.smartClient.model
    c3i.smartClient.widget

    Also, each of these API's expect FIXED picks as input

    IOW, they do not include a SAT solver


    c3i.smartClient.fm
        will transparently wrap the above 3 API's to provide fixup service

Temporary plan:

    separate the 4 API's into 2 modules

    Module 1: c3i.smartClient:
        c3i.smartClient.service:
            initially, we will just provide this for EFC
            with no fixup, no widgets, no MVC, and no session management
            this becomes a very small value add above and beyond image model

    Module 2: c3i.smartClient2:
        c3i.smartClient.model:  temporarily broken
        c3i.smartClient.widget: temporarily broken
        c3i.smartClient.fm:     doesn't exist yet

        Module 2 will temporarily be removed from the project
