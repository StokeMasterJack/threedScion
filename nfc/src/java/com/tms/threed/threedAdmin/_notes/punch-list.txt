Make local checkout faster byt using propper .gitattributes  and .gitignore files

need to make ThreedModel thread - safe, preferrably immutable with a builder
    reasons:
        it is held in a cache in repos and repos is a public facing, shared var
        If ThreedModel is not thread-safe then Repos is not thread safe

        is messed up for json model servlet:
        http://127.0.0.1:8080/configurator-content/avalon/2011/3d/models/5c97a58444dcf98cf49602302c37fbc113942d00.json

repoUrl no longer is in threedModel
        i fixed testHarness to get the repoUrl another way
        must do the same for eBro and nfc

make sure gwt app is being cached, especially all of the style-sheets and images, pulling down menu is sluggish

try gpu with more threads
