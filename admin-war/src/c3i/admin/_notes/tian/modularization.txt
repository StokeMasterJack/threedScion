Modularization

Goal: make c3i modular such that:

1.  It can still be used in its current stand-alone capacity
2.  It can be leveraged from EFC which has it's own sat solver and FM


Modules:

Image Model: takes picks, view, angle outputs image stack

jpg gen service
    start job

New Ideas from JS meeting
    how to create a hash-based job-id that is more appropriate to the scope of the jpg-gen-job:
        csp = csp.select("tundra","2014)
        csp = csp.reduce() //lossy reduce
        String sha = csp.sha();
